# LocationTestApp


1. Used drawer layout to create the sliding menu with list of cities, when the button is clicked. 

2. I used a geocoder to get the GeoLocation values of the selected city name instead of hard coding the lat long values.

3. Used the Google Maps API to load the maps. The API key is located in res/strings.
